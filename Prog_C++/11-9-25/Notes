##  Pointer
    A pointer does not store any data,but if refers to where the data is stored by its address.
    Pointer takes only 1 byte. Pointer can only refers to its own datatype.
    p->1200
    p->int---1200 to 1204  4bytes
    p->char--1byte
    p->1200 to 1201

    Pointer Operator:
        &: address of operator
        *: value at address of operator

        eg: x=10
            int *p=&x;
            &x or p or &p--->1200
            x=x+5
            *p--->15
            *p=*p+10;
            x-->25
    
    C++ was last language to have pointers. Why?
    ->This was due to the security issue.A pointer can directly go & access some memory,
    which was against security policies
    Sol-> Reference(Python,Java,....)
        Close pointer that means the address never exposed. The operating system maintains security &
        control by mapping an alias with an internal address.
        eg-> int x=10;
            int &alter_x=x; //&denotes alias

## Double Pointer
    It is the pointer pointing to another pointer
    int **var;

    eg->

## Pointer to Array
