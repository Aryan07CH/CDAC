Java is Case Sensitive language.

Identifier is a user-defined name given to variables, constant, class, method, packages, interface.

Rules:-

 	A keyword can't be a identifier.

 	Identifier name can't contain space, special character's.

 	Identifier cannot start with digit.

 	Identifier can be the combination of alphabet's, digits, underscore.

 	Identifier can be of any length.

Naming Conventions:-

Class:-

 	First letter of the class name should be in uppercase.

 	If class consists of more than one word first letter of each word should be capital.

&nbsp;	Java class name should be a noun



 		 JDK-> javac and JRE->JVM



If you make source code change you must recompile the source code.

.class file is created only if there are no syntactical errors in source code.

System and string are both built in classes offered by java



Variable is named container in memory which can store a value and the value can be change(value can vary)

To declare a variable in java use following syntax:-  data\_type nameofVariables

Java offers following 8 primitive datatypes they are as follows

-byte		-float		-char 			-boolean

-short		-double

-int		value with  	a single char  		true or false

-long		decimal value   in single quotes

values without

decimal value



eg:-

**int rollno=10;**

**float marks=89.98;**

**char ch='Y';**

Boolean result=



Convention for Variable Name:-

-It should be small and meaning full

-First letter of first word should be in small case

-If variable consists of multiple words except first word first letter of each word should be in upper-case

-It should be small and meaningful.



Narrowing is explicitly done by typecasting

Widening is implicitly done





Syntax of Method declaration

access\_specifier return\_type nameofMethod(argument/s if any){}



access\_specifier is optional

Method Name Convention:-

-Method should start with a verb such as display, calculate, accept, show etc

-Method name also consists of verb followed by noun such as calculateSalary()

-Method name must have first letter of first word in lower-case

-If it consists multiple words the first letter of each word except first should be in uppercase.



In Java a method cannot be defined directly inside another method.

Java is statically type of language.



Method is executed only if you call or invoked.



Java supports following 3 types of comment:

1. Single line comment-> //
2. Multiline Comment-> /\*    \*/
3. Documentation Comment-> /\*\*  \*/



Operators:

-Operators are the one which performs operations on operands.

Type:-

1. Assignment operator:-

 	It is use to assign a value to a variable eg age=20

2\. Relational Operators:-

 	< , > , <= , >= , != , ==

3\. Arithmetic Operators:-

 	+ , - , \* , /

4\. Logical Operators:-

 	\&\&- Both condition should be true

 	||- Any one condition must be true

 	! - If no condition is true



In Java, for any conditional expression value must result to boolean type.If not compilation error occurs.



It is not mandatory to write break after each case. But Execution of cases will happen till 1st break is encounter.

This Process is known as Fall Through an Execution

Use case of switch case is menu driven application





IDE:-

It offers following features:

1. Indentation
2. Auto-Completion of code
3. Curly braces matching
4. Colour Highliting

These features helps devloper to write code quickly with less efforts and time Hense while working on real projects you'll prefer using IDE

In Java Community Following are few popular IDE's-> Eclipse,STS,intellij,NetBeans
